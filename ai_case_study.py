# MediMusic's MediBeat Music Therapy App

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

MediMusic Ltd.

* When was the company incorporated?

MediMusic was founded December 2, 2016 with a focus on improving the well being 
and quality of life of patients and health care workers through music therapy." [^1]

* Who are the founders of the company?

MediMusic was founded by Matthew Weldon (CEO) , and Gary Jones (CTO) and has .
Matthew is a Award winning tech leader with experience delivering full stack 
software and IoT projects for the likes of Nestle, IKEA, Siemens Gamesa and
Ideal Boilers. Gary is an Award-winning product entrepreneur with 30 years 
expertise in content management and music. Has worked on projects for the likes 
of Sony, Intel, Yahoo, PRS and News International." [^2]

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Music therapy or "Receptive Sound Therapy" is not a new concept however it has only begun to be studied with 
scientific research modern day. Gary Jones said himself:
"We have all self-medicated with music at some point in our lives. Whether it is 
listening to relaxing tracks on a lazy Sunday morning, or turning up the volume 
for some up-tempo music when getting ready to go out for the night, music can be
simultaneously cathartic and stimulating. It can lift the soul, calm our anxieties, 
or keep a mood constant.There is no question that music and health have a strong, 
symbiotic relationship. Great thinkers through history, from the ancient Greek 
philosopher Plato, through to Friedrich Nietzsche, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy and 
Albert Einstein have all noted its impact (Einstein even wrote a book called A 
Short History of Music). My favourite quote is probably that of civil rights 
campaigner Martin Luther King, who recognised music’s power to heal, claiming; 
“My heart, which is so full to overflowing, has often been solaced and refreshed 
by music when sick and weary.Furthermore, since the early 1960s, thousands of
peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials have investigated the impact music has 
on humans – both psychological and physiological. In fact, the PubMed Bio Science 
library has over 25,000 documents that demonstrate the benefit of music to a 
multitude of health cases, from mental health, dementia, pain relief, autism, 
palliative care, Parkinson’s, physio-recovery and many more. In fact, there are 
no illnesses or uses to which a benefit cannot be brought." [^3] 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

MediMusic is a tech start up by Hull Health that was created at an incubator called
C4DI in the UK. MediMusic is funded by 3 investors: University of Hull, Sauce Consultants,
and Finance Yorkshire. MediMusic has raised a total of £1.2M in funding over 1 round. 
This was a Venture - Series Unknown round raised on Sep 22, 2022." [^4]


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

MediMusic is designed to reduce heart rate and stress hormones like cortisol 
and promotes relaxation through hormones like dopamine and oxytocin. The music is
played through the MediBeat streaming device, headphones, and a heart rate monitor 
worn on the wrist. It could revolutionise the treatment of dementia, pre/post operation, 
chronic pain, dentistry, and Alzheimer’s Disease through to improving motor response 
as part of a physical rehabilitation programme." [^5]

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Our collective scientific knowledge of maths, physics, sociology, psychology, 
neurology and physiology along with music, enables us to deliver a service that 
addresses the need to reduce anxiety and pain across a wide range of healthcare 
issues including dementia, pre/post operation, chronic pain, dentistry, 
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Autism through to improving motor response as part 
of a physical rehabilitation programme." [^6]

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

MediMusic’s has its own MediBeats device that fingerprints algorithms scientifically
mimic the human brain’s response to individual music tracks. Within a couple of 
clicks personalised playlists are auto-created that cause a positive physiological 
and emotional response.By using an optional heart rate monitor our Artificial 
Intelligence-driven Digital Drip™ analyses a listener’s physiological response to 
the playlist tracks. The Digital Drip knows what that response should be." [^6]

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
 (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s 
 engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

 MediMusic uses MediBeat device that uses s a full Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 
 that shows reports of the bio-loop vitals using a wearable heart rate variability (HRV) monitor that 
 responds to what they call the DIGITAL DRIP™ that adjusts tracks to bring the 
 heart rate down faster or in slower steps. It also reports important information
 such as pain, and medication reduction. The workflow compliant app has a simple 
 intuitive interface, customisable patient specific functional scale that dovetails
 into multiple existing workflow practices. It also uses an end-to-end Service 
 with multiple hardware options including Alexa, and bone conducting waterproof 
 headphones." [^6]

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?

Wearable biosensors have received tremendous attention over the past decade, mainly 
concentrated in the healthcare industry, which attempts to apply physical signals 
such as heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, respiratory rate and body 
motion to extract clinically relevant information. Wearable biosensors refer to 
biological sensors, including watches, clothing, bandages, glasses, contact lenses 
and rings, that are conveniently attached to a person’s body, and provide a function 
that distinguishes them from existing devices in terms of portability, ease of use and 
environmental adaptability. As healthcare regimes shift more toward personalized medicine, 
globally wearable sensors will have an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
approximately 38% from 2017 to 2025." [^7]

* What are the other major companies in this field?

Endel Pacific uses patented technology that creates soundscapes that adapt in real-time. 
It reacts to inputs like time of day, weather, heart rate, location, and an integrative
automotive system that helps you stay calm and focused on the road. It has partnerships 
with Universal Music Group and Sony." [^9] 

SonicTonic is a music therapy app that offers a variety of therapeutic soundscapes 
and compositions for different wellness goals, such as stress reduction, sleep 
improvement, and more. The app may integrate with compatible wearable devices to

NHS Foundation Trust, found the use of MediMusic saw an up to 22% reduction in heart 
rate in patients with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used in 
hospitals, care homes and dentist surgeries and could slash medication bills by up 
to a quarter. Music therapy has already been proven in several previous studies to 
reduce anxiety by 44% and pain by 28%. This has resulted in a reduction in the need 
for relevant medication by 24%." [^5]

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

MediMusic produces substancial results in metrics of elivated emotional and physiological responses, 
stress reduction, lowered heart rate, and stabilizing blood pressure. Clinical outcomes 
of symptom reduction, and enhancement of quality of life. Personalization and adaptability 
to customise music to preferencescu considering factors like cultrual back ground and therapeutic
goals." [^12]"

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination.)

It would advise MediMusic to encorporate virtual reality in combination with their music therapy, 
but that is why I am learning programming, so that they will be asking me to be an 
archetect that project. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Virtual reality combined with therapies like music and psilocybin produce incredible
results. We deeply need these unusal and newer technologies to not only heal, but to 
advance our evolution as a species.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Immersible experiences have the ability to create profound positive outcomes. 
I would also add event services that would provide live DJing and VR experiences
for patients to come together and have a community expereince. The need for health
oriented community is so important for over all well being. 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution

Mental health problems is at an all time high. Harm reduction technology is needed
more than ever. By using technology with the intention to create a better quality 
of life we can create a kinder, wiser, healthier world.
